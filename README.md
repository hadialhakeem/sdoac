# Six Degrees Of Anime Characters

This web app shows you how connected any 2 seemingly random anime characters are.
Two characters are considered connected if,

- They are in the same anime or,
- They share the same voice actor/actress.

With just these 2 criteria, we're able to connect (almost) any 2 arbitrary characters. 
The app will display the shortest path, and when there is 1 shortest path the most "popular"
path is picked.
